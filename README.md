#APSim

Project migrated from Sourceforge; cccccc1 is my username there. Everything below is mostly copied from there.

##Description

APSim is simply a project started on 23 December 2010 that deals with creating a 3D simulation of particles, the particles being of certain materials included in the simulator.

It strives to create an environment that is realistic, while also trying to achieve decent FPS. The particles in the game interact, creating reactions and new particles (of course it is very CPU consuming).

The user is placed into a virtual environment, and has many tools at his/her disposal. Particles can be placed, removed, pushed, evaporated, dragged, attracted, etc. In fact, many different possibilities can take place.

A somewhat fair comparison is to a 3D version of the famous Powder Game.
